- name: Real-time combination of material flow simulation, digital twins of manufacturing cells, an AGV and a mixed-reality application
  role: Developer
  timeline: "Mar 2020 - Jul 2020"
  image: /images/sections/projects/dipro.png
  url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212827121011690
  summary: I developed the simulation model containing the digital twin of a manufacturing cell and the AGV. The model communicated via MQTT broker with a mixed-reality application and was used to visualize the real-time state of the system.

- name: Laundry Order Consolidation System (LOCsys)
  timeline: "Jan 2018 - Feb 2020"
  role: Developer
  image: /images/sections/projects/locsys.png
  url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjuDn0SNLVI
  summary: My task was to develop a simulation model of a new designed laundry order consolidation system. The model was used to evaluate the performance of the new system and to identify potential bottlenecks. The "LOCSys" project was funded as a joint project by the BMWi as part of the Central Innovation Program for SMEs (ZIM).
